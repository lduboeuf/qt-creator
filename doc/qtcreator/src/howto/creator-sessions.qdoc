    \title Managing Sessions

    When you exit \QC, it stores a snapshot of your current workspace as a
    \e session. To restore the session automatically when you start \QC,
    select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol Sessions > \uicontrol Manage >
    \uicontrol {Restore last session on startup}.

    When you open or create any of the following items, they automatically
    become a part of the session:

    \list

        \li Projects
            \if defined(qtcreator)
            with their dependencies (including SUBDIRS projects when using
            qmake)
            \endif

        \li Editors

        \li Breakpoints and expressions

        \li Bookmarks

    \endlist

    A session is personal, that is, not meant to be shared. It is not supposed
    to reflect the project structure. It contains personal data, such as
    bookmarks and breakpoints that are usually not of interest to other
    developers working on the same projects.

    For example, if you work on a project and need to switch to another project
    for a while, you can clone the current session to save it under a name and
    create a new session for the other project. Everything that you open after
    switching to the new session becomes a part of it. When you want to return
    to working on the first project, switch to the saved session. \QC opens the
    projects and files that belong to the session.

    To manage sessions, select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol Sessions > \uicontrol Manage.

    To save a session under a new name, select \uicontrol Clone.

    To create a new session:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol New.

         \li In the \uicontrol {Enter the name of the session} field, enter a
             name for the session.

        \li Select \uicontrol Create to create a new empty session or
            \uicontrol {Create and Open} to create a session and to switch to
            it.

    \endlist

    To switch between sessions, select \uicontrol {Open}.

    \if defined(qtcreator)
    The \uicontrol Projects tab in the \uicontrol Welcome mode lists existing
    sessions. To open a session, select it or press
    \key Ctrl+Alt+<number>, where \e <number> is the number of the session to
    open (available for the first nine sessions).

    You can also use the \c t locator filter to open a session. For more
    information, see \l{Searching with the Locator}.

    To view more information about a session, select the down arrow icon that
    appears when you move the mouse cursor over the session name. Select actions
    to clone, rename, and delete sessions.

    When you start \QC from the command line, you can give the name of
    a session as an argument and \QC will start with this session.

    For more information, see \l{Command-Line Options}.
