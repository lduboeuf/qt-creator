    \title Select the build system

    You can use several build systems to build your projects:

    \list
        \li \l {Build with CMake}{CMake} is a cross-platform system for build
            automation that helps simplify the build process for development
            projects across different platforms. It automates the generation of
            build configurations. For more information, see \l {Setting Up CMake}.
        \li \l{qmake Manual}{qmake} is an alternative to CMake for automating the
            generation of build configurations. Qt installers install and
            configure qmake. To use one of the other supported build systems,
            you need to set it up.
        \li \l {https://mesonbuild.com/}{Meson} is a fast and user-friendly
            open-source build system that aims to minimize the time developers spend
            writing or debugging build definitions and waiting for the build system
            to start compiling code. For more information, see \l {Setting Up Meson}.
        \li \l{Qbs Manual}{Qbs} is an all-in-one build tool that generates a build graph
            from a high-level project description (like qmake or CMake do) and executes
            the commands in the low-level build graph (like make does). For more
            information, see \l{Setting Up Qbs}.
    \endlist

    Typically, you select the build system when you create a project.

    \section1 Migrate to another build system

    To export a project to some other build system, such as Microsoft Visual
    Studio, select \uicontrol Build > \uicontrol {Run Generator}, and select
    a generator in the list. \QC generates the build files, such as .vcxproj,
    in the project's build directory.

    The tool that you use to build the project (qmake or CMake) provides the
    generators. Their availability depends on the version of the build tool,
    host platform, and properties of the host system.
    Also, a JSON compilation database generator is available if the
    \l{Parsing C++ Files with the Clang Code Model}{Clang Code Model plugin}
    is enabled (default).

    \section1 Set preferences for building and running

    To change the location of the project directory, and to specify settings
    for building and running projects, select \uicontrol Edit >
    \uicontrol Preferences > \uicontrol {Build & Run} > \uicontrol General.

    Specify build and run settings for different target platforms, in the
    \uicontrol Projects mode.
