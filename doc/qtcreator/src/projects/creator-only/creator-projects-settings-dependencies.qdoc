    \title Specify dependencies

    If you have multiple projects loaded in a session, you can define the
    order in which they are built. For example, if project A depends on project
    B, project B must be built first.

    \note The build order is stored as a property of a session, not a project.
    You must open the session for these settings to take effect.

    \image qtcreator-build-dependencies.png {Dependencies settings in Projects mode}

    To define the build order of projects within a session:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol Projects > \uicontrol {Project Settings} >
            \uicontrol Dependencies.

        \li Select projects that must be built before the current project is
            built.

        \li Select the \uicontrol {Synchronize configuration} check box to
            use the same kit as well as the same build and deploy
            configuration to build and deploy all dependent projects loaded
            in a session.

    \endlist

    \QC calculates the build order based on the dependencies that you
    specify for the projects loaded in the session.

    \note You cannot use this view to specify subprojects for projects.
