    \title Connecting QNX Devices

    You can connect QNX devices to the development PC to deploy, run and debug
    applications on them from within \QC. The QNX Neutrino RTOS has additional
    command-line tools and services, as described in \l {Qt for QNX}.

    \note In Qt 6, \QC support for QNX is considered experimental.

    \section1 Adding a QNX Neutrino Device in \QC

    Adding a QNX Neutrino device is very similar to
    \l{Connecting Remote Linux Devices}, except that
    you need to select \uicontrol {QNX Device} in the
    \uicontrol {Device Configuration} wizard.

    \section1 Add kits for QNX Devices

    To view QNX device settings, select \uicontrol Edit > \uicontrol Preferences >
    \uicontrol Devices > \uicontrol QNX. Select the \uicontrol {Generate kits}
    check box to allow \QC to generate kits for QNX development.
