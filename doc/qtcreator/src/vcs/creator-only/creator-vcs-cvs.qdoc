    \title CVS

    \brief Additional CVS functions.

    CVS is an open source version control system.

    In addition to the standard version control system functions described in
    \l {Use common VCS Functions}, you can select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol CVS > \uicontrol Edit to set a file as writable, notify
    watchers that the file is being edited, and watch for actions performed
     on the file by other users.

    To discard the changes that you made in a file, notify watchers that
    the file is no longer being edited, and set the file as read-only,
    select \uicontrol Unedit.

    To unedit files in the local directory, as well as recursively in all
    subdirectories, select \uicontrol {Unedit Repository}.

    \section1 CVS Preferences

    To set CVS preferences, select \uicontrol Edit > \uicontrol Preferences >
    \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol CVS:

    \image qtcreator-preferences-vcs-cvs.webp {CVS preferences}

    \list
        \li \uicontrol {CVS Command} specifies the path to the command-line
            client executable.
        \li \uicontrol {CVS root} specifies the CVS root.
        \li \uicontrol Timeout sets a timeout for version control operations.
        \li \uicontrol {Diff options} sets preferences for viewing diff output.
        \li \uicontrol {Describe all files matching commit id} annotates all
            files that belong to the commit.
    \endlist
