    \title Fossil

    \brief Additional Fossil functions.

    Fossil is an open source distributed version control system, designed
    and developed by the creator of SQLite. A stand-alone Fossil executable
    has a source control management engine, web interface, issue tracker,
    wiki, and built-in web server. Fossil is available for Linux, Windows,
    and \macos.

    To use Fossil from \QC, you must install and configure it, as described in
    the following sections.

    \section1 Configuring Fossil

    \list 1
        \li Download the \l{http://fossil-scm.org}{Fossil SCM client} and
            install the \c fossil executable file in your \c PATH.

        \li Create or designate a directory to store local Fossil repositories
            and remote clones. For example: \c ~/fossils/qt.

        \li Select \uicontrol Edit > \uicontrol Preferences >
            \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol Fossil, and set the
            designated directory in the \uicontrol {Default path} field.

    \endlist

    To create a local Fossil repository, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Fossil > \uicontrol {Create Repository}.

    To clone a remote Fossil repository, select \uicontrol File >
    \uicontrol {New Project} > \uicontrol {Import Project} >
    \uicontrol {Fossil Clone}.

    \section1 Additional Fossil Functions

    In addition to the standard version control system functions described in
    \l {Version Control Systems}, the \uicontrol Fossil submenu has
    the following items:

    \table
        \header
            \li Menu Item
            \li Description
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Pull
            \li Pull changes from the remote repository.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Push
            \li Push committed changes to the remote repository.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Update
            \li Change the version of the current checkout. Any uncommitted
                changes are retained and applied to the new checkout.
        \row
            \li \uicontrol Settings
            \li Configure the settings of the local repository.
    \endtable

    \section1 Fossil Preferences

    To set Fossil preferences, select \uicontrol Edit > \uicontrol Preferences >
    \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol Fossil:

    \list
        \li \uicontrol Command specifies the path to the command-line client
            executable.
        \li \uicontrol {Default path} sets the path to the directory to store
            local repositories by default.
        \li \uicontrol {Default user} specifies an existing user who becomes the
            author of changes made to the repository.
        \li \uicontrol {SSL/TLS identity} sets the SSL/TLS client identity key
            to use for authentication if the server requests it.
        \li \uicontrol {Log count} sets the maximum number of lines the log can
            have.
        \li \uicontrol {Log width} sets the width of log entry lines to 20 or
            above. The value 0 shows a single line per entry.
        \li \uicontrol {Timeout} sets a timeout for version control operations.
        \li \uicontrol {Disable auto sync} disables automatic pull before
            a commit or update and automatic push after a commit or tag or branch
            creation.
