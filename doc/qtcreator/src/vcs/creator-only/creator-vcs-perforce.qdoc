    \title Perforce

    \brief Additional Perforce functions.

    Perforce is a fast software configuration management system developed by
    Perforce Software.

    \section1 Enabling the Perforce Plugin

    To enable the Perforce plugin:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol Help > \uicontrol {About Plugins} >
        \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol Perforce.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Restart Now} to restart \QC and load the plugin.
    \endlist

    \section1 Configuring Perforce

    To set Perforce preferences, select \uicontrol Edit > \uicontrol Preferences
    > \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol Perforce:

    \image qtcreator-preferences-vcs-perforce.webp {Perforce preferences}

    In \uicontrol {P4 command}, set the path to the command-line client
    executable.

    Set workspace details in \uicontrol {P4 user}, \uicontrol {P4 client}, and
    \uicontrol {P4 port}.

    To specify the details individually for several projects, use configuration
    files instead. Create a \c {p4config.txt} configuration file for each
    project in the top level project directory, and run
    \c{p4 set P4CONFIG=p4config.txt} once. You must deselect the
    \uicontrol {Environment Variables} check box.

    \section1 Editing Files

    In addition to the standard version control system functions described in
    \l {Use common VCS Functions}, you can select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Perforce > \uicontrol {Edit File} to open a file for editing
    within the client workspace. By default, files are automatically opened for
    editing. To disable this feature, select \uicontrol Edit >
    \uicontrol Preferences > \uicontrol {Version Control} > \uicontrol Perforce,
    and then deselect the \uicontrol {Automatically open files when editing}
    check box.

    To list files that are open for editing, select \uicontrol Tools >
    \uicontrol Perforce > \uicontrol Opened.

    To group files for commit, select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Perforce >
    \uicontrol {Pending Changes}.

    To view information about change lists and the files in them, select
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Perforce > \uicontrol Describe.
